# ebb

A minimalistic iOS app with widgets that help to convert your phone to a dumbphone.

## What's a dumbphone?

Think back to basic cellphones where you could only make calls and maybe send some mail - a dumbphone is a simplified mobile phone.

In a time where screens always take your attention, a dumbphone diminishes and eliminates those distractions. Much like a tide will **ebb** and recede, this app aims to help you wash away any digital interruptions.

This project has been inspired by Blank Spaces and Dumbify and simply includes my own customizations :)
